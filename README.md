Three branches exist. The first is "script" this is the original verion, first used as a script. It is included mainly for completness. It is in Python 3.3

"Program" was the branch intended to become a complete program. While it acheived the minimum level required to be considered successfull, a branch was made. "Program", like "script", is in Python 3.3

"Program2.7" is, you guessed it, in Python 2.7. This change was made for compatability with pyinstaller. All futher development will be on this branch.
